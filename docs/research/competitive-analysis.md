# Australian PropTech Competitive Analysis
## Land Feasibility & Planning Data Platforms

*Research date: March 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

The Australian PropTech market for land feasibility and planning data is fragmented. No single platform provides an end-to-end solution covering planning controls extraction, feasibility modelling, and development management. The biggest unsolved problem remains **DCP (Development Control Plan) digitisation** -- the detailed, council-specific design rules (setbacks, parking, landscaping, acoustic requirements) that ultimately determine what can actually be built on a site. Most platforms handle LEP/zoning data reasonably well but fall short on granular DCP controls. This represents LandQ.AI's primary competitive opportunity.

### Limitations
- **Geographic coverage**: Originally VIC and NSW only; expanding to QLD but not yet national for all features
- **No feasibility engine**: Shows planning data but does not calculate yield, GFA, or financial feasibility
- **No DCP detail**: Shows zoning/overlays but does not extract specific DCP controls (setbacks, parking rates, design requirements)
- **No 3D design**: No design or massing capability
- **No API for most tiers**: API access restricted to Enterprise
- **Document costs extra**: Title searches and planning certificates are pay-per-document on top of subscription

### User Complaints
- Coverage gaps outside VIC/NSW
- Data can lag behind actual council updates
- No integrated feasibility or yield calculation
- Expensive when document searches are factored in
- Limited analytical capability -- essentially a data viewer, not an analysis tool

---

| Professional | $345 | $287.50 | 1 paid + unlimited free | 1 state, unlimited site size |
| National | $595 | $495.83 | 1 paid + unlimited free | All states, unlimited |

Title searches and contamination reports are pay-per-use on all tiers. Annual billing = 2 months free.

### Limitations
- **DCP controls are incomplete**: While Archistar covers LEP-level controls (zoning, FSR, height, permitted uses) well, detailed DCP-level controls (specific setback rules, parking rates, landscaping requirements, acoustic controls) are not comprehensively digitised across all councils
- **Generative design is indicative, not DA-ready**: 3D designs are concept-level massing studies, not architectural drawings; still require architect refinement
- **Financial feasibility is basic**: Provides yield metrics but lacks the sophisticated cashflow modelling, GST margin scheme, and Australian finance structures that developers need
- **Learning curve**: Menus are hidden or require training to sequence correctly; workflows take time to learn
- **File format limitations**: Cannot import many common file formats
- **Planning rule accuracy varies by council**: Some councils have more complete rule digitisation than others
- **No project management or CRM**: Purely an analysis and design tool; no pipeline tracking
- **Price barrier**: National coverage at ~$500/mo is significant for smaller developers

### User Complaints
- Planning rules not always up-to-date with latest council amendments
- Designs don't always reflect real-world DCP constraints accurately
- Cannot replace professional town planner advice
- Limited import/export format support
- Learning curve for non-technical users
- Expensive for occasional use

- **No planning data**: Like CoreLogic, Pricefinder is purely a sales/valuation platform with no zoning, planning controls, or constraint data
- **No feasibility tools**: No yield, cost, or financial modelling
- **No developer features**: Built for agents and valuers, not developers
- **Search can be unreliable**: Users report the search function sometimes fails to find the right property, requiring scrolling through hundreds of addresses
- **Overlap with CoreLogic**: Very similar product to RP Data; choice often comes down to which platform the user's agency provides
- **Domain ecosystem lock-in**: Best data comes from Domain listings; less comprehensive for off-market or REA-exclusive listings

### User Complaints
- Search functionality issues (can't find properties reliably)
- AVM estimates can be significantly off in thin markets
- Less comprehensive than CoreLogic for some data types
- Limited analytical tools beyond basic reports

## 5. PropCode (propcode.com.au)

*Emerging competitor -- most directly relevant to LandQ.AI's planning data ambitions*

### What They Provide
- **DCP digitisation**: The only platform that has systematically converted DCP rules to machine-readable "rules as code"
- Rapid Planning Reports (RPR): Analyses DA rules from LEPs, DCPs, and SEPPs with clickable rule citations
- PropCode CDC: Instant eligibility analysis for Complying Development pathways
- PropCode Library: Free viewer for NSW LEPs, DCPs, and SEPPs in one integrated tool
- Pass/fail evaluations for individual planning rules linked to property spatial data
- Coverage of NSW housing reforms (Low and Mid Rise, Transit-Oriented Development, Housing SEPP)

### Data Sources
- **Council websites**: DCPs gathered from hundreds of council websites across NSW
- **NSW Planning Portal**: LEPs and SEPPs
- **AI-assisted extraction with expert review**: 1,000+ rules converted to software rules using AI with human verification
- **State spatial data**: Property data linked to rules via spatial data for automated pass/fail evaluation

### Pricing Model
- Single property analysis available
- Starter Plan: Monthly subscription for professionals (DA and/or CDC reports)
- Business Plan: Team subscriptions with unlimited CDC summaries
- Bulk Datasets: Custom planning analysis datasets ordered by suburb or LGA
- PropCode Library: Free

### Limitations
- **NSW only**: Currently limited to New South Wales; no VIC, QLD, or other states
- **No financial feasibility**: Planning rules analysis only, no yield or cost modelling
- **No property/sales data**: No valuations, sales history, or market data
- **No design tools**: No 3D massing or design generation
- **No constraint mapping**: No flood, bushfire, contamination overlays (beyond what's in LEP/DCP rules)
- **Early stage**: Still building out council coverage within NSW
- **Rules maintenance burden**: DCPs change frequently; keeping 1,000+ digitised rules current is a significant ongoing challenge

### Why This Matters for LandQ.AI
PropCode is the closest competitor to what LandQ.AI aims to do with DCP data. They have proven the approach works (AI-assisted extraction with expert review, rules as code) but are limited to NSW and planning analysis only. LandQ.AI's opportunity is to combine this capability with feasibility modelling, property data, and project management.

## The DCP Problem: Who Has Cracked It?

### Current State
The DCP/detailed planning controls problem remains largely unsolved at scale:

1. **PropCode** is the furthest along, having converted 1,000+ DCP rules to machine-readable code for NSW councils. Their approach: AI-assisted extraction with expert review, creating "rules as code" linked to spatial property data for automated pass/fail evaluation. But they are NSW-only and still expanding council coverage.

2. **Archistar** covers LEP-level controls nationally (zoning, FSR, height, permitted uses from 25,000+ sources) but DCP-level granularity (specific setback formulas, parking rate tables, landscaping percentages, acoustic requirements) is incomplete and varies significantly by council.

3. **Landchecker** shows planning zone and overlay information but does not extract or interpret DCP rules.

4. **No platform** comprehensively covers DCPs across multiple states.

### Why DCPs Are Hard
- **Not standardised**: Each of NSW's 128 councils has its own DCP. Victoria and Queensland have similar council-level detail in their planning schemes
- **PDF-based**: Most DCPs exist as large PDF documents (often 200-500+ pages), not structured data
- **Context-dependent**: Rules vary by zone, site size, frontage, proximity to features, and other variables
- **Frequently amended**: Councils regularly update DCPs; keeping digitised rules current is a maintenance burden
- **Cross-referencing required**: A single development may need to comply with LEP + DCP + SEPP + state codes simultaneously
- **Nuanced language**: DCP rules use qualitative language ("must be sympathetic to the streetscape") alongside quantitative controls

### North Sydney Council Initiative (September 2025)
Notably, North Sydney Council restructured their entire DCP 2025 specifically to enable integration into AI platforms for development assessment. This signals government recognition that DCP digitisation is coming and councils are beginning to prepare their documents for machine readability.

---

## Key Gaps That LandQ.AI Could Fill

### 1. Integrated Planning-to-Feasibility Pipeline
**Gap**: No single platform takes a user from address input through planning analysis, yield estimation, and financial feasibility in one workflow.
- Archistar does planning + basic design but weak on financial feasibility
- Feasly does financial feasibility but has zero planning data
- CoreLogic/Pricefinder do valuations but no planning
- **Opportunity**: LandQ.AI can be the first platform to connect planning rules extraction directly to a sophisticated feasibility engine

### 2. Comprehensive DCP Digitisation
**Gap**: PropCode has proven the approach for NSW but no one covers multiple states. Archistar's DCP coverage is shallow.
- **Opportunity**: Use LLM-powered extraction (similar to PropCode's approach but leveraging more advanced AI) to systematically digitise DCPs across NSW, VIC, and QLD. Start with highest-activity councils

### 3. Land Acquisition CRM + Planning Intelligence
**Gap**: No platform combines a developer-focused CRM/pipeline with planning data.
- Developers currently use Excel/email to track opportunities and separately log into Landchecker/Archistar for planning info
- **Opportunity**: LandQ.AI's Land Acquisition module with integrated planning data is genuinely unique

### 4. Project Management Post-Acquisition
**Gap**: No planning data platform extends into post-acquisition project management.
- After a developer buys land, they switch to generic project management tools
- **Opportunity**: LandQ.AI's unified lifecycle approach (acquisition -> feasibility -> project management -> sales) has no direct competitor

### 5. Council Intelligence Database
**Gap**: No platform captures institutional knowledge about council attitudes, processing times, common conditions, and assessment officer tendencies.
- This is currently trapped in the heads of experienced town planners
- **Opportunity**: Build a crowd-sourced or AI-aggregated council intelligence layer

### 6. Automated Constraint Screening with Risk Scoring
**Gap**: Archistar and Landchecker show constraint overlays but don't synthesise them into a single risk score or automated go/no-go recommendation.
- **Opportunity**: AI-powered risk scoring that weights constraints by severity and generates a plain-English risk summary

### 7. Comparable Sales Integrated with Yield Analysis
**Gap**: CoreLogic/Pricefinder have sales data. Archistar has yield tools. Nobody connects comparable end-product sales back into yield-driven feasibility automatically.
- **Opportunity**: "What would 12 townhouses sell for on this site?" answered in one step, not three platforms

---

## Recommended Competitive Positioning for LandQ.AI

### Primary Differentiator
**"The only platform that connects planning rules to feasibility to project management in one system."**

### Build vs. Integrate Strategy
| Data Type | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Zoning/LEP data | Build (government WFS/API endpoints are open) |
| DCP controls | Build (LLM extraction -- core IP) |
| Constraint overlays | Build (government open data) |
| Property valuations | Integrate (CoreLogic or Domain API) |
| Aerial imagery | Integrate (Nearmap or Aerometrex) |
| Sales/listings data | Integrate (Domain API free tier, CoreLogic enterprise) |
| Cadastral/boundaries | Build (state open data + Geoscape) |
| Feasibility engine | Build (core IP, Australian-specific) |
| CRM/pipeline | Build (core product) |
| Project management | Build (core product) |

### Priority Data Moats
1. **DCP rules-as-code database** -- hardest to replicate, highest value
2. **Council intelligence** -- crowd-sourced/AI-aggregated institutional knowledge
3. **Integrated feasibility models** -- planning controls feeding directly into financial models
4. **Historical DA outcome data** -- learn from what gets approved/refused by each council
