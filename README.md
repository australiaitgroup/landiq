# LandIQ

An AI-powered property development platform that helps Australian real estate developers manage land acquisition, feasibility analysis, project development, and property sales in a unified system.

**Live Pitch Deck:** [https://landgear.github.io/landiq-brand/pitch](https://landgear.github.io/landiq-brand/pitch)

## Problem

Australian property developers face significant challenges during the land acquisition process:

- **Complex due diligence** — Zoning, planning overlays, council regulations, environmental constraints, flood risk, transport access, and more
- **Fragmented information** — Data scattered across council portals, GIS systems, PDFs, Excel spreadsheets, and consultant reports
- **Manual reporting** — Feasibility reports still written by hand in Word + Excel, taking 2–4 weeks per site
- **High sunk costs** — Each abandoned site costs $100K+ in wasted due diligence investigations
- **No unified system** — Land opportunities, reports, and decisions managed through email and shared folders

## Solution

LandIQ is a **Property Development Operating System** that consolidates the entire development lifecycle into one platform, powered by AI to automate analysis and report generation.

### Core Modules

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Land Acquisition** | Land CRM with pipeline management (Lead → Research → Feasibility → Negotiation → Acquired) |
| **Feasibility Engine** | AI-powered analysis of zoning, density, development potential, and planning risks with auto-generated reports |
| **Document Management** | Centralised hub for all feasibility reports, consultant documents, contracts — searchable, version-controlled, AI-tagged |
| **Chrome Extension** | One-click site intelligence overlay on REA, Domain, and Landchecker listings |
| **Email Hub** | Multi-account email aggregation with AI auto-linking to land sites and auto-tagging |
| **Project Management** | Post-acquisition project tracking — timelines, stages, contractors, consultants, approvals |
| **Property Sales** | Unit inventory, pricing, buyer tracking, sales pipeline, contract management (Phase 2) |

### AI Capabilities

- **Feasibility Report Generation** — Input an address, get a full report (site overview, planning analysis, development potential, risks, recommendations) in minutes instead of weeks
- **Planning Document Interpretation** — Automatically parse council PDFs, zoning rules, and planning overlays via LLM
- **Risk Detection** — Flag flood zones, environmental restrictions, heritage overlays, and planning conflicts
- **DCP Rules Extraction** — Digitise council-specific design controls (setbacks, parking, landscaping) from PDF documents

### Value Proposition

| Metric | Traditional | With LandIQ |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Desktop feasibility time | 2–4 weeks | Under 1 hour |
| Desktop feasibility cost | $22K–$63K per site | ~$5K per site |
| Cost reduction | — | ~80% |
| Sites screened per month | 2–3 | 10+ |
